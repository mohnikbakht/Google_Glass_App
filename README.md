# Google Glass App (Kotlin)

We developed an Android app for Google Glass as a user interface for our werable patches ([link to Our Wearable Patches!](https://github.com/mohnikbakht/Cardio_Wearable_Patch_Demo)). By using the Google Glass platform we can record SCG and ECG signals in real-time and process for immediate treatment. The medical specialist can monitor the processed information whcih would help in makeing a more accurate decision.
